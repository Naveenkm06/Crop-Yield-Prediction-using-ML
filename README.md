# Diabetes_Prediction
A diabetes predicting model using tensorflow.

The model predicts wheter a woman suffers with diabetes or not based on the woman's number of pregnancies, BP, BMI, age etc.

We have analysed the trends and built a tensorflow sequential model.

Flowchart : importing modules --> loading dataset --> data visualization --> scaling and randomsampling --> splitting test,train and dev sets -->building the model -->testing on test data
