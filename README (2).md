Rice Crop Yield Prediction using ML

This project focuses on predicting rice crop yields using machine learning techniques. It utilizes data from Tamil Nadu, India, to develop predictive models that can forecast yields based on various agricultural parameters such as area, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium usage. The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural stakeholders in making informed decisions to optimize crop production.
